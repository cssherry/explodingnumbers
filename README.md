## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Create FallingScreen (~0.5 day)
Make the falling numbers and initial layer of numbers. Display this on the screen.

### Phase 2: Display Equations (~0.5 days)
Make random equations show up on page. These equations will differ depending on difficulty.

### Phase 3: Enable clicking of numbers (~0.5 day)
Use jQuery UI to make each number clickable, also register the number that is clicked.

### Bonus Features
- [ ] Random bombs to clear all instances of a random number.
- [ ] Point system based on difficulty and final score can be saved.
- [ ] Two modes, default mode ends game when numbers reach top of screen, timer method will return score at the end of 5 minutes.

## Technology used:
### JavaScript
- jQuery
  - jQuery UI
- AJAX
- YAML to save scores
